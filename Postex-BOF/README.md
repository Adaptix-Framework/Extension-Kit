## ScreenshotBOF

An alternative screenshot capability that uses WinAPI and does not perform a fork & run:
- JPEG is used in place of BMP
- Added beacon screenshot callback option
- Removed BMP renderer (it will be missed)
- Supports capturing of minimized windows

```
screenshot_bof [-n note] [-p pid]
```

The screenshot will be saved in the AdaptixC2 screenshot storage.
